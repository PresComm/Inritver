# Inritver

#### Description:

A PowerShell utility that scans networks to search for BitLocker status on Windows machines. Requires admin privileges on the target machines.

#### Usage:

When run under the context of a user with admin privileges on the target machines, Inritver will iterate through a user-supplied target or target list and pull BitLocker status for each Windows machine contacted.

Accepted parameters:

-targets

Specifies the target(s) to be scanned.

Examples: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.25-50, 192.168.1.0/24

-intarget

Allows user to specify an input file of targets, one entry per line (see -targets example for acceptable input types.)

Example: .\input.txt

-output

Specifies the output format (if left blank, no file will be output; results will be written to the terminal.)

Currently supported output options: TXT, CSV, HTML

-filepath

Specifies the path for the output file (cannot be used without -output; if left blank, no file will be written [I will address this in an upcoming update]).

Example: C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Output.txt

-help

Displays help information.

Accepted values: true

#### Notes:

- Now supports single IPs, IP ranges, and subnets of any size!
- Now supports parameters only via the command-line; no more interactive prompts.
- Now has a -help parameter!
- Functions have been re-added.
- Now attempts to connect to potential targets on TCP port 445 before polling for BitLocker status. Speed is significantly increased as a result (I realize this may lead to false negatives and blank input for non-Windows SMB/Samba shares or other services running on this well-known port. I will continue to polish this feature in future updates.)
- Now supports input text files containing a list of targets. This means the user can supply a mixture of single IPs, IP ranges, and subnets of any size for a single scan!

#### Plans:

- Allow for verbose output of scanning process.
- Allow for non-CIDR subnet masks (such as 255.255.255.0).
- Possible support for non-domain or out-of-permission targets.
- Possible support for user-supplied credentials at the command-line.
- Possible support for automatically pulling the local IP and subnet mask of the machine running the script to use as the input.

### Credit:

Credit for the portion of the script that performs subnet calculation based upon the user's inpurt goes to Mark Gossa on the Microsoft TechNet Gallery (https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PowerShell-Subnet-db45ec74). I ensured the license is fine for me to include this function in my script.
